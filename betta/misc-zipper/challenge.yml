  One of our spies has stolen documentation relating to a new class of missiles. Can you figure out how to hack them?

  "We have developed a new protocol to allow reprogramming missiles in flight. We send a base64 encoded string representing a specifically formatted zip file to control these missiles. The missiles themselves verify each command before executing them to ensure that a hacker cannot manipulate them."

  A sample message has also been stolen by our spy.
