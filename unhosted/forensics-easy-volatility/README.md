# Easy Volatility

This challenge is just to introduce the contestant to the volatility framework. You just have to download the image and profile, copy the profile into the correct place (system dependent), and run

```sh
vol -f debian11.core linux.bash.Bash
```

## FAQ

### Kernel requirement unsatisfied
The profile wasn't installed to the correct location, or you forgot to uncompress it. Read the documentation and try again.

### Volatility just prints nothing when I run a command
I legitimately am at the end of my rope trying to figure out why this happens. It's driving me nuts. Uninstall it all, turn everything off and back on, and then reinstall it. If it still happens, try to con other people in the discord into helping you fix it.

### I just got some weird text / should I include the `#`?
Try it and see!

### I can't figure out how to install volatility
Try using Linux ðŸ˜›

### Where do I put the profile?
It's in a weird spot that's system dependent. Look at the documentation for where to put it on your system.
