The binary is what gets flashed to an Arduino UNO with a LCD display attached (see TinkerCAD's display). The program has a shuffled flag based on the permutation of elements in multiplicative modulo 29 group, which as 29 is prime has 28 elements. The bug therefore in main.cpp is that the algebraic operation f (modular exponentiation) should happen mod len + 1 (29), but is given len (28).
