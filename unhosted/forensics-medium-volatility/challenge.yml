  How long has this machine been up? Answer in _microseconds_.

  To help you sanity check your answer: I went and made myself lunch in between booting this machine and dumping it.

  If you are inexperienced with volatility, I recommend doing the easy problem first to get acquainted with it.

  > Note: the volatility challenges do not have a flag format to discourage grepping. They all should be possible without guessing. If you have trouble, remember that you can ask for help.
